A good financial tracking app should have the following features:

1. Budgeting tools: The app should allow you to set up a budget and track your spending against it. This can include features like categorization of expenses, alerts when you are approaching your budget limits, and the ability to set up and track savings goals.

2. Transaction tracking: The app should allow you to track your income and expenses, including the ability to import transactions from your bank and credit card accounts.

3. Net worth tracking: The app should allow you to track your net worth over time by calculating the value of your assets (e.g., investments, property) minus your liabilities (e.g., debts).

4. Alerts and notifications: The app should provide alerts and notifications for unusual activity, such as unexpected charges or large purchases.

5. Security: It's important that the app you choose has robust security measures in place to protect your financial data. This can include features like two-factor authentication and encrypted data storage.

6. Ease of use: The app should be easy to use, with a clean and intuitive interface that makes it simple to track your finances and stay on top of your budget.
